<div class="srcEntry"><span class="srcNumber"><a name="C1"></a>1. </span><span class="srcData">L Crow Email, 2005 (Edited by S Crow), &#8220;Percy Crow&#8217;s Career.&#8221;<br />
<br />   Percy Crow was first employed as a Tramways Conductor (after a few years as a pony boy in the pit) and then transferred to become a driver when motor driven vehicles were introduced.<br /><br />   At the start these were the only qualified drivers on the roads. Cars were just driven by anyone who had an hour or so to take them out on a road.  Chauffeurs and Taxi Drivers were the most experienced because they had use of someone's vehicle and drove regularly.  They also became engineers as they had to keep their cars on the road if they wanted to keep their job.<br /><br />   Percy's training route was from the Sheffield Road Garage to Birdwell Police Station then around the triangle of roads which surrounded the station where he had to stop for practice at loading and unloading of passengers.  He drove many hours around that triangle.  Also there was a lot of stopping and starting on hills on the way. If he stalled the bus he had to get out of the cab and swing the engine with a heavy starting handle making sure that when the engine fired he quickly disengaged the handle. If you didn't do this quickly enough the handle would swing around and may smash your wrist and may result in the loss of your job. The instructor never helped a driver but accidents and constant stalling would lead to your rejection as a driver and failure of the most coveted award of the Public Service Vehicle (PSV) License.<br /><br />   Percy so valued this license disc (which all early drivers had to wear when working) that he renewed it annually so that he always had a job as a driver.  Even when during the war he went to work as a centre lathe turner (he qualified in his own time after work at the Technical College) he kept his PSV badge and used it when he did some overtime relief driving on weekends after the war. His badge and driving license are in a box in the garage at Manor End. This extra work was valuable to provide holiday money which were one of the most important parts of his family life.<br /><br />   Percy only had one year when he was not awarded his Good Safe Driver Award. (The family has a medal he was given for many years of Safe Public Service Driving).  The missed year happened soon after Percy and Hilda got married and before Leslie was born.  Percy was driving a bus on a main road (Sheffield Road?) when another driver pulled across him from a side road. The bus although travelling at a steady speed couldn't slow down or stop soon enough and they ran into one another.<br /><br />   Percy was cut by glass on his forehead, a scar he carried till his death. Any driver involved in an accident was immediately suspended and had to go next morning before the boss, Mr. Robinson.  In spite of support from passengers on the bus and his explanation of his actions to try and stop an accident which was not his fault he was reprimanded but kept his job, subject to his safe driving in future years.<br /><br />   To say that from that moment on he was an even more careful driver (and taught Leslie to be so too) is an understatement. When driving a car or a bus he had a smoothness which endeared him to his passengers. He caressed the gears, listened to the engine and changed directions with consideration for others and the vehicle.  &#8220;Think for the other man&#8221;, he would say.  &#8220;Make up his mind by giving him space and consideration&#8221;. How he would have hated driving these days.  He was a very special Dad.</span></div>

<br />   William Mason Crow was named after his father's eldest brother. The name Mason was a mystery for a long time …… when Brenda started courting his son Jim Crow she was calling him Jim Mason and only found out that their married name would be Crow just before marriage. Brenda's maiden name was Marshall and they lived at 21 Tune Street. The house is no longer there.<br />   William had six children, two with each of three women. After some time William and his wife parted and he took up a partnership with his housekeeper Carrie Ward. With her he had two children called Edna and Billy. Billy died in an accident in Sheffield Road when he ran and tried to jump onto a moving tram (see newspaper article from 1923). Percy Crow who spent some time as a Tram Conductor was the Conductor on that tram. I assume that they all lived at 8 Tune St. William next had a relationship with another housekeeper Anne Mickman who bore him two children, Jim (Bev's Father) and Joan who died young. His son, Jim Robert Mason Crow lived at home until he married a short time after William Mason Crow died in 1953.  Jim found his Father dead in the chair one morning. William is buried in a simple grave marked with initials on a small marker only (?)<br />   William lived at 8 Tune St which was a row (town) house during this time and worked making and selling ice cream produced in the kitchen. He also sold his garden produce from a small handcart which he took around the local area. He was a regular pub-goer and had a personal friend who owned the Wharncliffe Arms lower down Sheffield Road (towards the Alhambra Centre). The pub is still there. The owner may have been a relation.<br />   Leslie Crow never visited the house or Tune Street where William Mason Crow lived as his mother Hilda was against the way the parents had treated Percy feeling they gave him little true love and guidance. Percy Crow spent many hours outside the family home with his Grandma who lived nearby, or working at the local grocers on evenings and Saturdays, bagging sugar and flour. The money earned was taken from him to help with the housekeeping. Young Percy was kept busy by his father in his spare time with &quot;pretend painting&quot; (or varnishing) the table legs with a brush dipped in a jam jar full of water. He could have been doing this while his father was painting as that was one of his jobs.<br />   William had a variety of jobs and a reputation for wandering in and out of regular employment although this may not have been his fault. These were difficult times and he didn't have a supportive wife and happy home. William was a very easy going man who tried to avoid unpleasant and upsetting situations. His escape was to the allotment gardens in the rear of Mount Vernon Hospital. This was the only place that Leslie visited him and then only on occasional drop-ins when accompanying his Dad Percy to the Wage Offices at the Yorkshire Traction offices on Sheffield Road. His grandson, Leslie loved going to the garden as there was always something to sample like fresh green peas or new tomatoes. William invariably gave him something to take home, 'for Hilda to cook', but always refused to make a visit when invited to come to Caxton Street. William grew but destroyed cucumbers over a water-tub in the centre of his greenhouse. The only thing good about them was the art of growing them he would say. Maybe this is why Leslie never liked cucumbers!</span></div>

<br />From: Les &amp; Margaret Crow<br />01 September 2005 18:18<br />Subject: RE: WM Crow's House!<br /><br />John's Street and Thomas Street are as you say across the Sheffield Road, behind the new Baptist Church (which replaced the original seen on photos in the Old Barnsley Streets Books -maybe in the one on your bedroom bookshelf.) and at the traffic lights half way down Sheffield Road by the Pub called 'The Outpost', Mum's horrible- &quot;wouldn't go there for a meal at any price pub&quot;.<br /><br />It's more than likely that you may not remember this area even though we pass it every time we go into Barnsley. Maybe you will remember where Alison went to Nursery School. That was in St John's vicarage and alongside the Church which was pulled down years ago. The streets are still there but most (all) of the houses have gone in the 60's.<br /><br />Chilton Street is still there and so are most of the houses. The Street has been made into a &quot;No Through Road' Cul-de-Sac to stop cars cutting through from Cemetery Road to Doncaster Road (possibly in the last 20years) We went down there and back up Doncaster Road stopping in a Working Men's Club Car Park for you to take photos of Galtee More my old Doctor's surgery.We passed both ends of Chilton Street which was regarded as a very nice area conveinient for a short walk down Sheffild or Doncaster Road into town. Both were regarded as good shopping areas with some high class shops and a pawnbroker!<br /><br />The area did suffer during and after the war and became a drop-out problem area so was cleaned up during road layout changes in the 50-60's. At one time you could go from the town centre along either Doncaster Rd. or up Sheffield Rd by either tram bus or car. At the junction of these two Roads was a large Methodist Chapel called The Ebenezer. it was a good landmark for directing travellers (i.e. left or right of the Ebenezer for Doncaster or Sheffield). You will find some good photos of these in the Barnsley book. David and Sheila Tingle went to and got married there just before Mum and I met in 1960. I went to their Wedding and took photos. When we next see them I'll ask if they have any old prints.</span></div>

<br />&#8220;Anne's family owned weaving mills in Scarborough. She had 2 sisters.  One was called Barbara Anne (a.k.a. Kitty). Anne died of TB before WM Crow died. They may be buried together at Cemetery Road graveyard (bottom of Tune Street, Barnsley - over the wall).&#8221;</span></div>

<div class="srcEntry"><span class="srcNumber"><a name="C5"></a>5. </span><span class="srcData">L Crow 9/2005 (Edited by S Crow), &#8220;The Linen Trade in Barnsley.&#8221;<br />
Sent: Saturday, September 03, 2005 11:15 AM<br />Subject: me interesting background info.<br /><br />Hi Steve,<br /><br />I've been looking through my Barnsley books and have come across some facts about the Linen Trade in Barnsley with special reference to the Sheffield Road area around Taylor Row which is near Quarry Street (not Lane as in your last info about my Family tree.) There is a Quarry Lane, Warren Quarry Lane which we drove up on our way back home after our photo tour on your Sunday. We passed the site of the old Dillington Dog Track and when we got to the top of the street we stopped for you to take what I called, 'the best views in Barnsley'It was at the top of Highstone lane where I took Mum for a bumpy ride the night before you was born! That's Warren Quarry Lane and across Park Road not far from St. John and Thomas Streets.<br /><br />Back to my readings. I have a series of Books which are made up of stories about various periods and happenings in the Barnsley area. People can send in items for inclusion and get these remembrances recorded. The Books are called 'Aspects of Barnsley' and up to now there has been seven editions.<br /><br />I have about six of them (No 2 is out of print) and in No3 I have just found an item called, &quot;Taylor Row and the Handloom Weavers of Barnsley&quot;. <br /><br />BTW Taylor Row was removed in the late 60's to make the turn off road to Doncaster Road off Sheffield Rd.<br />There are excellent photos and details from Census returns of families living here and in other parts of Barnsley including Sheffield Rd and Thomas Street areas who were involved in home based Hand Loom Weaving.<br /><br />The author tells of local people being joined by incomers from Ireland and Lancashire to take houses provided by various Mill Owners (such as Taylor's on Peel Street) for the production in the of linen cloth from yarn produced by the mill.<br /><br />What happened was that they produced their cloth after collecting yarn from Peel St. working in the basement of their back to back homes. The work room was half underground so that they could get into the living floor via steps to the house door and so that a window could be placed to give light to work by. When it was dark they used candles causing extra expense.<br /><br />To keep the yarn pliable it was better for the room to be slightly damp so conditions were bad and many died. Working hours were left to the family sometimes looms being used in shifts by all family members. It was payment by results so the more cloth you produced the more money you got.<br /><br />There are few details of families by name but there are graphs and lists to show which houses and how many looms were known to be in houses in Barnsley.<br /><br />If James Crow came from Ireland it is likely he and his wife became hand weavers as their first home was near this area.<br /><br />It says that many came from out of the area seeking work and without any experience of weaving, learning on the job. Much of their early efforts produced poor cloth and some were evicted from their tied homes. Tied means the Linen Warehouse owner owned the houses and looms and loaned them at a rent to weavers producing cloth for the factory to sell on.<br /><br />Another interesting fact is that in the beginning and more prosperous times weavers were allowed to keep a piece of cloth at the end of each roll called a Fent. These were used to make clothes, blankets, curtains, etc by the family. Otherwise they took them to the markets for sale.<br /><br />The bosses didn't like that as it challenged their sales efforts especially when times were hard.<br />When they stopped this privilege there were big riots in May Day Green.<br /><br />Because of the damp and unhealthy conditions gradually factories were set up where all the weaving was done under one roof and on power driven looms so home hand weavers were not needed and young men went to join the many who worked in the growing Mining Industry.<br /><br />There were several Linen Manufacturers and one warehouse is still there behind the Technical College. The old Joan's Clothes Warehouse just below the new Magistrates Court and Police Station on Churchfields.<br /><br />If you come over again I'll buy you a set of these &quot;Aspects of Barnsley&quot;<br />books. They are too heavy to send by post. If you tell me how to send it I'll try to scan the article. Maybe I should send articles by Fax.<br /><br />In your bedroom bookcase is Barnsley 1890s -1990s by Brian Elliot (who also edits the Aspects Books)on page 33 is the Alhambra Theatre and cinema and on 34 top is the end of Doncaster Road with the Ebenezer Chapel between there and Sheffield Road.<br /><br />Well that's all for now but I'm still searching and scribbling more notes.</span></div>

&#8220;It was not until 1863, though, that the first weddings took place, the tradition of going to Duffield obviously was still strong……….

Anyone interested in tracing the history of their family might like to examine the list of tombstones and memorials in the church and churchyard drawn up by Dr. James Mason. A copy is available for inspection on the notices rack in church……………….Saint Alkmund ——&gt; Duffield church is one of six in this country dedicated to St. Alkmund, an exiled Prince of Northumbria who was murdered in 800AD in Mercia at Northworthy (renamed Derby after a Danish Viking occupation in 877) by bodyguards sent by the usurping King Eardulf of Northumbria. He feared the prince would attempt to gain the throne of his father. Alkmund was canonised shortly afterwards at the request of King Kenwulf of Mercia and his remains enshrined in an existing but re-dedicated stone church in Northworthy in a sarcophagus which may be seen today in Derby Museum. That church sent priests out to spread the word of God. Duffield was a daughter church and received the same dedication as its parent, probably around 850AD. What became of it during the Danish rule in Derby 877-917 is unknown……..…..The first Church ———&gt; The first known record is that in the Domesday survey of 1086 which referred to a church and resident priest. That building is thought to have been the Saxon church, built of timber, of which there are no known traces. The church of today stands on the same site, close to the river Derwent, and a mile away from the village. Probably the reason for this was so that converts could be baptised by immersion. The church itself has been quite frequently immersed, most recently in the year 2000. The Saxon village had been built on the ridge for ease of defence and to avoid flooding……………. The present Church ———&gt; The building of the present church was begun by the Normans in the 12th century and originally cornprised a chancel and nave………<br />File: <a href="sm01/s01_019a.pdf" target="_src19-0">DuffBook_Pub</a></span></div>

A knocker-up's job was to rouse sleeping people so they could get to work on time……………There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns such as Manchester.
