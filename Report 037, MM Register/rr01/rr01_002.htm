<div class="rrSpouseData">On 23 May 1896 when Thomas was 50, he married <span class="rrSpouseName">Eliza Ellis</span> <a href="../wp01/wp01_207.htm"><img src="../img/i_photo.png" alt="" /></a>, daughter of <a name="P234"></a>Charles Ellis, in Barnsley, St Peters Church, Hoyland.<span class="rrFields"> Born in Mar 1842 in Billingley, Rotherham, Yorkshire. Eliza died in Barnsley, Yorkshire, in 1920; she was 77.</span><span class="rrNotes"><br />
<br />
Eliza first married Thomas NUSSEY, b: 1835, d: 1873 in Barnsley.  (Thomas Nussey's wife's name is missing from the FreeBMD Marriage Index - but it is Eliza). Thomas NUSSEY died just 4 months prior to Eliza NUSSEY, who was now a widow, married John CROW.  Eliza was pregnant by John CROW at the time of her second marriage.  Hannah CROW was born later in 1874.  (Hannah CROW was later known as Hannah MASON after Eliza&#8217;s third partner).  When John CROW died in 1877, Eliza CROW was widowed for a second time.  <br /><br />Eliza then had a long-term relationship leading 17 years later to her third marriage in 1896 with Thomas MASON. Their only child was William Mason CROW (b: 1879) who was born **17 years prior to their marriage** when her name was still Eliza CROW.  Their son William inherited Eliza&#8217;s surname CROW not the fathers as she was unmarried. <br /><br />Had Eliza been married to Thomas MASON when William Mason CROW was born William would have been called William MASON and our family name would have been MASON not CROW.<br /><br />This explains our family connection to the name CROW.  Also it explains the family connection to (and why William&#8217;s middle name was) MASON.<br />
