Sir John Carden also gave a training and recreation ground of 40 acres adjoining. The barracks had two squares, surrounded by company lines, stores, married quarters, officers mess block, church, military prison and hospital. The site was surrounded by a high wall, with projecting fire positions at each corner. It had accommodation as follows: C/O&#8217;s house and garden, quarters for two field officers, 23 other officers, married quarters for 48 other ranks, and for 767 other unmarried personnel. It also had 36 hospital beds, 15 guard room cells, and stabling for 27 officers&#8217; horses.&#8221; —  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCan_Barracks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCan_Barracks</a></span></div>

<div class="psEvent"><span class="colFirst">Gold Rush? Memo</span><span class="colSecond">It is quite possible (but not proved) that Robert Crow participated in the Australian Gold Rush which peaked at the same time as he arrived at its epicentre of Melbourne.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_gold_rush">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_gold_rush</a>  Records exist of a Robert Crow (not proved as ours) having children with a local Avoca, Vic. woman in the 1860s. Pursuing the &#8220;gold rush&#8221; in his circumstances and location would have been a logical choice.  &#8220;Like Ballarat and many other Victorian towns, Avoca sprang into being suddenly in the 1850s with the discovery of gold. Gold was first found in Victoria in 1849 in the Pyrenees Ranges near Avoca. But it was not for another two years that the first discovery of any importance took place. In 1851 a shepherd called James Esmond found gold at Clunes, forty kilometres from present-day Avoca, setting off a gold rush to the region.&#8221; — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoca,_Victoria#Early_settlement_and_the_gold_rush">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoca,_Victoria#Early_settlement_and_the_gold_rush</a></span></div>

(The Asylum remained a feature of the area until its move to Cheltenham in 1911.) In 1859 the area was named Hotham borough, after the governor of Victoria Charles Hotham. … Hotham had a population of over 7,000. … On 26 August 1887 the Borough was renamed North Melbourne Town, after the completion of the imposing North Melbourne Town Hall and the Metropolitan Meat Market.&#8221; — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne,_Victoria">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne,_Victoria</a></span></div>
