<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Mary Jane Smith</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Mary Jane was named after her mother's sister.</div>

<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for William Mason (Spouse 1)</div>

<div class="psNotesData">William Mason Crow lived at 8 Tune Street. The house is no longer there.  He was named after his father's eldest brother.  <br /><br />The name Mason was a mystery until very recently. Actually when Brenda started courting his son Jim Crow she was calling him Jim Mason and only found out that their married name would be Crow just before marriage. Brenda's maiden name was Marshall and they lived at 21 Tune Street. House no longer there.<br /><br />William had six children, two with each of three women. After some time William and his wife parted, divorced or she left him and he took up a partnership with his housekeeper Carrie Ward. With her he had two children called Edna and Billy. Billy died in an accident in Sheffield Road when he ran and tried to jump onto a moving tram (see newspaper article from 1923). Percy who spent some time as a Tram Conductor was the Conductor on that tram. I assume that they all lived at 8 Tune St.<br /><br />After a while William had a relationship with another housekeeper Anne Mickman who bore him two children, Jim (Bev's Father) and Joan who died young.<br /><br />Jim lived at home until he married a short time after William died in 1953.  Jim found his Father dead in the chair one morning.<br />He is buried in a simple grave marked with initials on a small marker only.<br /><br />William lived at 8 Tune St which was a row (town) house during this time and had a 'job' making and selling ice cream produced in the kitchen. He also sold his garden produce to anyone who would buy it from a small handcart which he took around the local area.<br />It is thought that he was a regular drinker and had a personal friend who owned the Wharncliffe Arms lower down Sheffield Road (towards the Alhambra Centre) The pub is still there. The owner may have been a relation.<br /><br />Leslie never visited the house or Tune Street where William lived as his mother Hilda was against the way the parents had treated Percy giving him little true love and guidance. Percy spent many hours outside the family home with his Grandma who lived nearby, or working at the local grocers on evenings and Saturdays, bagging sugar and flour.  The money earned was taken from him to help with the housekeeping.<br /><br />Young Percy was kept busy by his father in his spare time by &quot;pretend painting&quot; (or varnishing) the table legs with a brush dipped in a jam jar full of water. He could have been doing this while his father was painting as that was one of his jobs.<br /><br />William had a variety of jobs and a reputation for wandering in and out of regular employment although this may not have been his fault. These were difficult times and he didn't have a supportive wife and happy home.<br /><br />William was a very easy going man who tried to avoid unpleasant and upsetting situations. His escape to life in the allotment gardens in the rear of Mount Vernon Hospital.  This was the only place that Leslie visited him and then only on occasional drop-ins when accompanying his Dad Percy to the Wage Offices at Yorkshire Traction Sheffield Road.<br /><br />Leslie loved going to the garden as there was always something to sample like fresh green peas or new tomatoes. William invariably gave him something to take home, 'for Hilda to cook', but always refused to make a visit when invited to come to Caxton Street.<br /><br />William grew but destroyed Cucumbers over a water-tub in the centre of his greenhouse. The only thing good about them was the art of growing them he would say. Maybe this is why Leslie didn't like cucumbers!</div>
