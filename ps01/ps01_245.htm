<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Christopher Milton Sykes</div>

<div class="psNotesData">The Battle of the Somme (French: Bataille de la Somme), also known as the Somme Offensive was one of the largest battles of the First World War and continued from 1 July to 18 November 1916. By the time the winter set in and fighting had receded, more than 1.5 million casualties had been suffered by the forces involved. It is understood to have been one of the bloodiest military operations ever recorded.<br /><br />The massive loss of life, the negligible territorial gains and the unrelenting German resistance were to cause the Battle of the Somme to become a symbol that would affect the British national consciousness for generations to come, in the same way as the French were affected by Verdun.<br /><br />Overall, the first day on the Somme was a failure for the Allied forces. The British had suffered 19,240 dead, 35,493 wounded, 2,152 missing and 585 prisoners for a total loss of 57,470.[37] This meant that in one day of fighting, 20% of the entire British fighting force had been killed, in addition to the complete loss of the Newfoundland Regiment as a fighting unit.<br /><br />the Battle of the Somme fought from 1 July to 18 November 1916 as one of the main engagements of the First World War. It was fought between mixed French, British and Dominion forces and the German Empire in the Somme River valley in northern France.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pals.org.uk/barnsley/barnsley1.htm">http://www.pals.org.uk/barnsley/barnsley1.htm</a><br /><a href="http://www.pals.org.uk/barnsley/barnsley2.htm">http://www.pals.org.uk/barnsley/barnsley2.htm</a></div>
