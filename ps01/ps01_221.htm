Sir John Carden also gave a training and recreation ground of 40 acres adjoining.

<div class="psEvent"><span class="colFirst">Death Memo</span><span class="colSecond">He spent his last days here in North West Melbourne. The hospital still exists in Victoria but not at this location.  The cemetery where he was likely buried no longer exists as the site has been built over.  &#8220;North Melbourne's first institutions were built in the 1840s … In the 1850s a Benevolent Asylum was built between Abbotsford and Curzon Streets, coinciding with the desire to find space to accommodate the growing population from the gold rush. (The Asylum remained a feature of the area until its move to Cheltenham in 1911.) In 1859 the area was named Hotham borough, after the governor of Victoria Charles Hotham. … Hotham had a population of over 7,000. … On 26 August 1887 the Borough was renamed North Melbourne Town, after the completion of the imposing North Melbourne Town Hall and the Metropolitan Meat Market.&#8221; — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne,_Victoria">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne,_Victoria</a></span></div>

<div class="psEvent"><span class="colFirst">Sep Memo</span><span class="colSecond">Hannah (White) Crow was separated from her husband Robert Crow when in 1842 he was transported to Van Diemens Land. She remained in Barnsley and remarried twice. &#8220;Hannah White's second marriage could be seen as being bigamous being only 4 years after Robert [CROW] went to Van Diemen's Land. She should have waited until 1849 as 7 years after the transportation of a convicted criminal was the relevant timescale for a legal remarriage.&#8221; (RogerBean20, 28 Sep 2008, ancestry.co.uk).</span></div>
