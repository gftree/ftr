<div class="psEvent"><span class="colFirst">O Memo</span><span class="colSecond">Knocker Up, Knocker-up<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />A Knocker-up (sometimes known as a knocker-upper) was a profession in England  and Ireland  that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution , before alarm clocks  were affordable or reliable. A knocker-up would wake up very early (sometimes as early as 3:00 am) to rouse sleeping people so they could get to work on time. Usually, the knocker-up was male and most often used a long and light stick (often bamboo), with pieces of wire attached at the end - to reach windows on higher floors and wake their clients at whetever time their clients requested. In return, the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week for this job. The knocker-up would not leave a client's window until they were assured the client had been awoken. Knocker-ups usually worked in larger cities like London or Liverpool.<br />Great Expectations , by Charles Dickens  includes a brief descrition of a knocker-up. Hindle Wakes  a play written by Stanley Houghton  and then a movie (of the same title) directed by Maurice Elvey, includes a knocker-up. Mary Smith, by Andrea U'Ren  is a children's picture book based on the real Mary Smith a knocker-up.<br />Mrs. Molly Moore (daughter  of Mrs. Mary Smith, also a knocker-up and the protagonist  of a children's picture book  aptly entitled &quot;Mary Smith&quot;) claims to have been the last knocker-up to have been employed  as such. Both Mary Smith and Molly Moore used a long rubber tube as a peashooter  - to shoot dried peas at their client's windows.<br />Some knocker-ups worked freelance ; their clients would either post the time they wished to be woken next to their doors, in their windows, or verbally, in advance. Some knocker-ups were employed by mills or larger factories to wake their large workforce on time.<br />Although the profession of knocker-ups became obsolete with the advent of readily available alarm clocks, the expression knock up is still used in Britain and Ireland to refer to waking someone at a set time in the morning, especially at a hotel. (Use of the phrase by British travellers in North America is a well-known gaffe , because knock up is also a Canadian slang term (occasionally used in the U.S. as well) meaning &quot;to impregnate&quot;.)</span></div>

<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Eliza Ellis</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Eliza first married Thomas NUSSEY, B: 1835, D: 1873 in Barnsley.  (Thomas Nussey's wife's name is missing from the FreeBMD Marriage Index - but it is Eliza).<br /><br />Thomas NUSSEY died just 4 months prior to Eliza NUSSEY, who was now a widow, married John CROW.  Eliza was pregnant by John CROW at the time of her second marriage.  Hannah CROW was born later in 1874.  (Hannah CROW was later known as Hannah MASON.)<br /><br />When John CROW died in 1877, Eliza CROW was widowed for a second time.  She had a long-term relationship leading 17 years later to marriage in 1896 with Thomas MASON.  Their only child was William Mason CROW (B: 1879) who was born 17 years prior to her 3rd marriage when her name was still Eliza CROW (though widowed and though the father was Thomas MASON whom she eventually married 17 years later).<br /><br />This explains our family connection to the name CROW.  Also it explains the family connection to the name MASON.<br /><br />Had Eliza been married to Thomas MASON when William Mason CROW was born he would have been called William MASON and our family name would have been MASON not CROW.</div>

<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for John (Spouse 2)</div>

<div class="psNotesData">The CROW name is passed on through John and Eliza's 2 girls under these surnames (which are not easy to trace within last 100 years):<br /><br />1) Hannah HARRIS (m) b: 1879<br />and her daughter Fanny BULLOCK (m) b: 1893<br /><br />2) Sarah Ann RENNISON (m) b: 1876<br />and her daughter Eleanor b: 1896<br />and her son Thomas RENNISON b: 1898<br />and her son John RENNISON b: 1900<br /><br />This is how the CROW name evolved/changed in the lineage tangential to William Mason CROW from whom we are descended.</div>
